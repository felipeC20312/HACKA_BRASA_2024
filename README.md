# HACKA_BRASA_2024: Tokenization for the Democratization of the Capital Market
This repository contains the code and documentation for our project for HACKA_BRASA 2024. Our goal is to develop an innovative tokenization solution that facilitates access to the capital market, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. The solution aims to allow investors to diversify their portfolios with high-quality assets in a transparent, efficient, and secure manner.

# Project Description (Overview)
We envision a future where small and medium-sized businesses have the same access to the capital market as large corporations. Our tokenization solution facilitates the issuance of tokens backed by receivables, governed by smart contracts tailored to each debtor. Additionally, we offer investors easy access to various investment opportunities, allowing them to track the performance of their tokens in individual portfolios.
